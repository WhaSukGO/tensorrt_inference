# TensorRT

Training a RetinaNet model using NGC, Open Images, 

## Issues

Tuesday, 30 June 2020

Training the model is done. 

The link, "Speeding Up..." , has somehow been removed? Currently, waiting for Nvidia's answer about the issue.

Added a preprocessign step from [AastaNV/TRT_object_detection](https://github.com/AastaNV/TRT_object_detection/blob/master/main.py); however, triggers a core dumped error.
